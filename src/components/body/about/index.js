          Hello,
         <br /> <span className="info-name">I'm Kevin</span> ðŸ‘‹
         <br /> I spent the last 10 years in medical sales and am now making a transition into tech. I have a strong passion for front-end web development and I'd love to help grow or maintain your business. I'm a lifelong learner, and am currently taking courses on Python. In my free time, I like to watch sports and cook for friends and family.
